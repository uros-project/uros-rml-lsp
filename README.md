# UrosRML Language Server

A Language Server and VS Code extension for UrosRML, a ubiquitous resource modeling language.

This project provides rich language features for the `.rml` file format, enhancing the development experience within Visual Studio Code. It's built using TypeScript, the Language Server Protocol (LSP), and the ANTLR parsing framework.

-----

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Syntax Highlighting**: Get accurate syntax highlighting for all UrosRML keywords, data types, and constructs.
  * **Syntax Diagnostics**: Catch syntax errors in real-time and see them displayed directly in the editor, helping you find and fix issues quickly.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you'll need the following installed:

  * **Node.js and npm**: The runtime environment and package manager for the project.
  * **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Required to run the ANTLR 4 tool.
  * **ANTLR 4 Tool**: Download the `antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar` file from [antlr.org](https://www.antlr.org/download.html) and place it in a convenient location (e.g., your project root or a globally accessible path).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url] # Replace with your actual repository URL
    cd uros-rml-language-server
    ```

2.  **Install npm dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Generate the ANTLR parser**:
    This step uses the ANTLR tool to generate the Lexer and Parser from the `UrosRML.g4` grammar. Make sure you're in the `uros-rml-language-server` directory.

    ```bash
    java -jar antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar -Dlanguage=JavaScript -o src/parser src/grammar/UrosRML.g4
    ```

    *(Note: If you placed `antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar` in a different location, adjust the `java -jar` path accordingly.)*

4.  **Compile the project**:

    ```bash
    npm run compile
    ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage in VS Code

Once the project is compiled, you can run the extension in debug mode directly from VS Code.

1.  Open the `uros-rml-language-server` project in a VS Code window.
2.  Go to the **Run and Debug** view in the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+D`).
3.  From the dropdown at the top, select **"Launch Extension"**.
4.  Click the green play button to start the debugger.

A **new VS Code window** (the "Extension Development Host") will open. You can now create a new file with the **`.rml`** extension and start writing your UrosRML code. The language features you've implemented (like syntax highlighting and error diagnostics) will be active in this window.

## üìÅ Project Structure

  * `src/grammar/UrosRML.g4`: Your ANTLR 4 grammar file for the UrosRML language.
  * `src/parser/`: This directory will contain the JavaScript parser and lexer files generated by the ANTLR tool.
  * `src/server.ts`: The core of the Language Server, handling all communication with the VS Code client via the Language Server Protocol (LSP). This is where you'll implement more advanced language features.
  * `src/extension.ts`: The VS Code client-side extension that activates and manages the Language Server.
  * `syntaxes/uros-rml.tmLanguage.json`: The TextMate grammar file for basic syntax highlighting.
  * `package.json`: The npm and VS Code extension manifest file, which defines dependencies and extension capabilities.
